Google and the internet have become an integral part to our daily lives, yet we often
overlook the intricate processes and mechanisms involved in retrieving information.
This project explores how web adaptation has evolved, particularly following the introduction of the page-rank algorithm, focusing on Google’s search engine. Various techniques,
such as page click rates, loading times, key-word relevance, and other user metrics which
are incorporated alongside the page-rank algorithm into Google’s search engine will be
uncovered.
Through this investigation, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of the sophisticated
strategies employed by modern search engines, shedding light on the constantly changing
structure of information retrieval in the digital age.
